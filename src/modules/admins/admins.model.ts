// This file is intentionally left blank for consistency with the project structure.
// In this application, database models are defined in the Prisma schema file (schema.prisma)
// and automatically generated by Prisma as TypeScript types in @prisma/client.
// Prisma handles all model definitions, relationships, and database interactions,
// eliminating the need for manual model definitions in this file.
// For model details, refer to the schema.prisma file in the prisma directory.
